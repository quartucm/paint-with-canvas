###Paint with Canvas

You could say this was inspired by melted crayon artwork.

This is a little demo of the Canvas API. Press any key and it will paint to the canvas and drip off the screen. I am using Canvas, requestAnimationFrame and ES6 Modules bundled with Webpack.

To run locally:

    npm install
    npm build
    
The letters and placed randomly, so you will have new artwork each time you draw.
